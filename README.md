### The 3 Point Revolution
My multivariate analysis problem involves 3 point shooting in the NBA and how it impacts winning percentage. This problem is of great interest to me because I love basketball, and I feel that 3 pointers have changed the way the game is played. The problem is a regression task, as I hope to use 3 point shooting statistics as a predictive measure of wins and losses in the NBA. I took data from the NBA seasons between 2014-2018 because these years represented the Golden State Warriors dynasty. The link to my video presentation of this project is below:
